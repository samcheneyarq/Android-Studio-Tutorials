#Setting up Android Studio

The following guide will explain how to set up Android Studio so that you can do as much as possible from the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This will make your coding more efficient and help you better understand developer operations (DevOps). 

- [ ] Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzJ3FoeiN9wIVFH8rCh3LvQomEAAYASAAEgJuWvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) (AS) 


- [ ] Set up an [Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator)

- [ ] Set up [Github](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)

This step will be project specific. You will need to speak with your Tech Lead to find out which Version Control Repository (repo) your team will be using. Sign into the appropriate platform and connect it with Android Studio.


- [ ]  Understanding Git in Android Studio

There are lots of options for handling Git (command line, SourceTree, Fork...) but before you jump into any of those, the [Version Control tools](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-use-git-in-android-studio-part-1-a8a554006aad) built into Android Studio are great and will help you understand how everything works together!
