#Setting up Android Studio

The following guide will explain how to set up Android Studio so that you can do as much as possible from the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This will make your coding more efficient and help you better understand developer operations (DevOps). 

1) Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzJ3FoeiN9wIVFH8rCh3LvQomEAAYASAAEgJuWvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) (AS)


2) Set up an [Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator)


3) Set up a [Physical Device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device)


4) Set up [Charles](https://developers.mopub.com/publishers/tools/charles/)


5) Set up [Github](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)

This step will be project specific. You will need to speaking with your tech lead to find out which Version Control Repository (repo) your team will be using - it will most likely be Github or Bitbucket. Sign into the appropriate platform 


6) Understanding Git in Android Studio
